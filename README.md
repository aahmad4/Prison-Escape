# Prison Escape 

An aerial prison escape game made with Python and Pygame. I created this game out of a personal interest for Pygame and to get better at object orientated programming at the same time. This was definitely a fun game to make as well as a fun game to play. I have this game shared on repl.it [here](https://repl.it/@aahmad4/Prison-Escape) or below, but I recommend running the game locally for a smoother experience.

## Gameplay

## Rules

The rules of the game are very simple:
* Upon initializing the game, there are 5 lives given and you are spawned in level 1. After clearing a certain amount of prisoners, you can regenerate to the next level. 
* Below your character, the police man, there is a health bar which keeps track of your current hitpoints. If you loose all your hitpoints, the game ends. You loose hitpoints by running into a prisoner or by getting shot by one of their lasers.
* Likewise, everytime a prisoner gets past you, you loose a life. If you hit 0 lives, the game ends.
* Move the character with your arrow keys and shoot your lasers with the space bar.
